# InterpolatedRendering
New rendering technique for 3D graphics, similar to vector graphics, but in 3D space.
Currently the basic foundation, nodes and handles, is working. Simple wire-frame rendering is in place, and some rudimentary OBJ loading is there.
Right now, I would greatly appreciate if anyone can help with filling the shapes, preferably I'd like to manually set the pixels instead of using a Raylib function.
Hopefully this technique is as useful and applicable as I think it is.
